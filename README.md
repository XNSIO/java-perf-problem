# Java Performance

If you look at the [Loop with if-else](src/com/xnsio/perf/PrimitiveDataMapper.java) class, you would immediately notice that the complexity of this code is quite high. I guess this is done for performance reasons.

Can you refactor the code so that is performs well and is easy to read/maintain?
